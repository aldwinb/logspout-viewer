# logspout-viewer #

Just a way to view Docker container logs.

# Installation (optional) #

If you want to install the script so that you can run it from any directory, you can do so by running:

```
bash install.sh
```

# Usage #

From the root directory of this repository, execute:

```
bash run-logspout.sh
```

It will start displaying logs emitted to [logspout](https://github.com/gliderlabs/logspout).
This will block the terminal session where it was ran.

If you installed the script first, you can execute from any directory:
```
run-logspout
```
